Experimental report

1. The experimental method:

    Using domsMatch P1, P2, 1000 31, P1 and P2 can be:
    randomPlayer, idiotGreedyPlayer, smartGreedyPlayer, cleverPlayer. 
    The first three types of players can run domsMatch directly for testing.
    CleverPlayer tests it in a special way.

2. The experimental resultsï¼š

    i. Direct play:

        RandomPlayer vs randomPlayer = (506,494)
        IdiotGreedyPlayer vs randomPlayer = (973,27)
        SmartGreedyPlayer vs idiotGreedyPlayer = (562,438)
        CleverPlayer vs smartGreedyPlayer = (620,380)
        (During the development process, there was also a verySmartGreedyPlayer which was obviously better than the smartGreedyPlayer when tested, but was later renamed verySmartGreedy Tactic, so they couldn't be tested.)

    ii. Strategy:

        CleverPlayer uses a variety of strategies, including:
        1. Guessing the opponent's cards.
        2. Blocking the opponent.
        3. Blocking myself.
        4. Blocking both players.
        5. Filter out the cards that help the opponent score 61 points after I play cards.
        6. Trying to avoid the opponent scoring high points.
        7. When blocking an opponent, consider choosing a card which will give me the highest score next move.

        To demonstrate that each strategy improves the win ratio, first run cleverPlayer vs. smartGreedyPlayer and get (620,380)
        Then replace the key code for one certain strategy with a random strategy and run cleverPlayer vs. smartGreedyPlayer again.
        If the running results are worse than (620,380), it proves that each strategy improves the winning rate.

    iii. Here are the test results:

        Cancel the opening strategy                                                                (620,380)
        Eliminate preferential play for 61 points                                                  (545,455)
        Random strategy instead of bad card strategy                                               (620,380)
        Random strategy instead of super-smart greedy strategy                                     (33,967)
        Random Strategy instead of blocking strategy                                               (612,388)
        Does not select my next highest score card while blocking the opponent                     (618,382)
        Guessing the opponent's cards does not assume that the opponent is using a greedy strategy (578,422)
        Do not take advantage of an opponent's block when guessing his cards                       (615,385)
        Don't guess, I always assume that my opponent has 9+10 cards                               (527,473)

3. Conclusion:

    Most strategies raise the winning interest rate, with only two exceptions. The two exceptions are the opening strategy and the bad card strategy.
